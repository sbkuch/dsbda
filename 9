Observations & Inferences:
Gender Difference:

The age distribution is slightly younger for females compared to males on average.

Survival Insight:

Among females, survivors tend to be younger, with a tighter age range.

Among males, there is a wider spread in ages for both survivors and non-survivors.

Outliers:

There are visible outliers (dots) indicating passengers with particularly high or low ages in each group.

Survival Rate by Gender:

More females survived than males, which aligns with the “women and children first” policy during evacuation.

Children:

Very young passengers (ages < 10) have higher survival rates, regardless of gender.
